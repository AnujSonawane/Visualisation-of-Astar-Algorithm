### What is A* Algorithm?
<p>A* Search algorithm is one of the best and popular technique used in path-finding and graph traversals.A* Search algorithms, unlike other traversal techniques, it has “brains”. What it means is that it is really a smart algorithm which separates it from the other conventional algorithms. 
And it is also worth mentioning that many games and web-based maps use this algorithm to find the shortest path very efficiently.</p>
