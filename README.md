### What is A* Algorithm?
<p>A* Search algorithm is one of the best and popular technique used in path-finding and graph traversals.A* Search algorithms, unlike other traversal techniques, it has “brains”. What it means is that it is really a smart algorithm which separates it from the other conventional algorithms. 
And it is also worth mentioning that many games and web-based maps use this algorithm to find the shortest path very efficiently.</p>

### Steps to execute the code
<p>1] install pygame in your system ( pip install pygame )</p>
<p>2]Execute the code and place your start(yellow) and end(cyan) points on the grid</p>
<p>3]create any number of barriers(black) between start and ene point and press space to start the visualization</p>
